# Welcome 


This is a simple and fun Windows Forms that manages the Products Table from the ProductDB databse:) It allows you to do the following:
-Searching for Product Number and Description
-Sort Units on Hand (asc)
-Search for Units on Hand that are a specified amount
-Sort the table by Price (asc)
-Search for the Min Price and Max Price

I had a fun time with this lab. Learned a lot. Did not take 40 mins like Mr. Thompson said it was lol.
